PROBLEM STATEMENT:
You have two numbers, and your challenge is to write a program that performs both 
addition and subtraction with them. However, if any subtraction results in a negative 
number, display it as a positive value. How will you tackle this and show the final 
results?

For example, consider two numbers 20 and 15. 
Addition of 2 values: 20 + 15 = 35.
Subtraction of 2 values: 20 - 15 = 5. 
For example, consider two numbers 20 and -150. 
Addition of 2 values: 20 + (-150) = -130 Absolute value of (-130) = 130.
Subtraction of 2 values: 20 - (-150) = 170.

SOLUTION:
import java.util.Scanner;
class AddSub {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        System.out.print("Enter the first number: ");
        int num1 = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter the second number: ");
        int num2 = scanner.nextInt();
        int add = num1 + num2;
        if (add < 0) {
            add = -add; // Convert negative to positive
        }
        int sub = num1 - num2;
        if (sub < 0) {
            sub = -sub; // Convert negative to positive
        }

        // Display results
        System.out.println("Addition of two values: " + add);
        System.out.println("Subtraction of two values: " + sub);
    }
}

SOLUTION:
Enter the first number: 20
Enter the second number: 15
Addition of two values: 35
Subtraction of two values: 5

PS C:\Users\vijay\OneDrive\Documents\JAVA> java add.java
Enter the first number: 20    
Enter the second number: -150
Addition of two values: 130
Subtraction of two values: 170

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
If the sum (add) is negative, it is converted to a positive value using add = -add
If the difference (sub) is negative, it is converted to a positive value using sub = -sub
Absolute Value Conversion Ensures all results are positive.
