PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To take three integer inputs from the user.Calculate and display the product of a, b, and c which should be in d and also divide the product of three integers and by its division values.

SOLUTION:
import java.util.Scanner;
class exp{
    
    public static void main(String args[])   {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int a=sc.nextInt();
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        int c=sc.nextInt();
        int d,e;
        
    System.out.println("value of a is " +a);
     System.out.println("value of b "  +b); 
    System.out.println("value of c " +c);
    d=a*b*c;
    System.out.println("the value of d is " +d);
    e=a+b+c;
    e=d/e;
    System.out.println("the value of e is "+e);
    }
}

OUTPUT:
34
67
90
value of a is 34
value of b is 67
value of c is  90
the value of d is 205020
the value of e is 1073

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
The program takes three integers a, b, and c as input from the user and displays their values.  
It calculates the product of the three numbers (d = a * b * c) and displays the result.  
It computes the sum of the three numbers (e = a + b + c) and then updates e by dividing `d` by this sum (e = d / e).  
Finally, it displays the updated value of e.
