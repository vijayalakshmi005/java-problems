reverse of is 34098765

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
The variable reverse is initialized to 0, and the program uses a while loop to extract and process each digit of the number.
In each iteration, the last digit (rem) is obtained using n % 10, added to reverse after multiplying reverse by 10, and the number n is reduced by dividing it by 10.
Thus te ouput is obtained by entering the while condition and checks that if the given n valiues does not equals 0 and after it follows each condition which is expalined and thus we can reverse the number.
