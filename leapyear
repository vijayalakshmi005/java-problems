OUTPUT:
it is not a leap year

DETAILED DEFINITION:
The above program explains that a given year is leap year  or not.
Leap year is a year which occurs every 4 year.
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. 
This accounts for the Gregorian calendar rules, where most years divisible by 4 are leap years, except for century years not divisible by 400. 
Examples: 2000 (leap year), 1900 (not a leap year).
