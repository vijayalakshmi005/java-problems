TERNARY OPERATOR:
The ternary operator in Java is a shorthand for the if-else statement. 
It has the following syntax:condition ? expression1 : expression2;
If condition is true, expression1 executes.
If condition is false, expression2 executes.


DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
String result = n1 > n2 ? "n1 is greater" : "n2 is greater";
It checks if n1 is greater than n2.
If n1 > n2 is true, result is assigned "n1 is greater".
Otherwise, result is assigned "n2 is greater".
