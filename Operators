PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Find the number belonging to which group above 50, between 40 to 50, less than 40.Write a Program to check the given number is divisible by both 3&4 if it is so print.
If a number is divisible by only 4 but not 3 then print "Good Afternoon"
If it is divisible by only 3 but not 4 then print "Good Evening" otherwise print "Good morning".


SOLUTION:

class divisible
{
    public static void main(String []args){
        int num1=30;
        if(num1%4==0 && num1%3!=0)
        {
            System.out.println("Good afternoon");

        }
        else if(num1%4!=0 && num1%3==0)
        {
            System.out.println("good night");
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("good morning");
        }
    }
}


SOLUTION:
good night

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
The program checks divisibility conditions for `num1 = 30`. If `num1` is divisible by 4 but not by 3, it prints "Good afternoon.
" If num1 is divisible by 3 but not by 4, it prints "Good night." Otherwise (if it's divisible by both or neither), it prints "Good morning."
The program uses the modulus operator (%) to check divisibility.  
'num1 % 4 == 0' checks if `num1` is divisible by 4.  
'num1 % 3 != 0' ensures `num1` is not divisible by 3.  
The logical AND (`&&`) ensures both conditions are true together.  
The logical OR (`||`)** is not used, but the else condition handles cases where neither condition is met.
