DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
This Java program generates the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, where each term (starting from the third) is the sum of the previous two.
The program initializes n1 = 0,n2 = 1, and count = 10, then prints the first two terms.
A for loop iterates from 2 to count, calculating n3 = n1 + n2, printing it, and updating n1 and n2. 
The main method serves as the entry point, executing the logic within the fibonacci class.
