PROBLEM:
What is the color of the traffic light?
If the answer is "red," print "Stop."
If the answer is "yellow," print "Get Ready"
If the answer is "green," print "Go."

SOLUTION:
import java.util.Scanner;
class col  {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter a color (red, yellow, green):");
        String colour = scan.nextLine();

        if (colour.equals("red")) {
            System.out.println("Stop");
        } else if (colour.equals("yellow")) {
            System.out.println("Get ready");
        } else if (colour.equals("green")) {
            System.out.println("Go");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid color");
        }
    }
}

OUTPUT:
Enter a color (red, yellow, green):
green
Go
