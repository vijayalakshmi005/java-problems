PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Get input for salary and age.
If salary greater than or equal to 20000 or age less than or equal to 25, get input for required loan amount. If not print you are not eligible for loan.
If required loan amount is less than or equal to 50,000 print You are eligible for loan. If it is greater than 50,000 print maximum loan amountis 50000

SOLUTION:

import java.util.Scanner;
class compare{
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("enter your salary:");
        int salary=sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("enter your age:");
        int age=sc.nextInt();
        if(salary>=20000 || age<=25)
        {
            System.out.println("enetr your loan amount");
            int loan=sc.nextInt();
            
        
          if(loan<50000){
            System.out.println("you are eligible for loan");
          }
          else{
            System.out.println("maximum loan amount is 50000");
          }
    }
        else{
            System.out.println("invalid input");
        }
    }
}

SOLUTION:
enter your salary:
23000
enter your age:
19   
enetr your loan amount
25000
you are eligible for loan

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
It checks if the salary is >= 20000 or the age is <= 25. If not, it prints "invalid input".
If eligible, it asks the user to input a loan amount.
Loan Amount Validation: It checks if the entered loan amount is less than 50000.
Based on the loan amount, it prints "you are eligible for loan" or "maximum loan amount is 50000".
